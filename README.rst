=================

Proposal submitted to the Python Software Foundation Mon Feb 6, 2017.

Grant Proposal
--------------

Provide funding to purchase renewal of python-pillow.org for maximum possible length of 8 years (as allowed by directnic.com).

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

The Python Imaging Library is one of the oldest and most popular third party libraries available to Python programmers today. It adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. [1]_

Pillow is a popular and well-maintained packaging fork of the Python Imaging Library. At the time of this writing it has been downloaded over a quarter million times from the Python Package Index. [2]_

History
~~~~~~~

Tired of seeing the proliferation of third party packagings of the Python Imaging Library, in 2010 Alex Clark took Hanno Schlicting's repackaging [4]_ and used it to create a fork of the Python Imaging Library on GitHub. He subsequently released that fork to PyPI as Pillow 1.0 [5]_.

The ability to add additional development library paths to ``setup.py`` (e.g. 64 bit library and headers directories) and make releases quickly eventually led to widespread adoption of Pillow.

A little over a year later on 2011-09-08, Takayuki Shimizukawa [6]_ uploaded the first Windows (win32) eggs. Since then, every Pillow release included Windows eggs thanks to Takayuki. And on 2013-02-02, the first 64-bit Windows eggs (amd64) were uploaded to PyPI by Takayuki.

For the first 3 years, the fork focused on packaging fixes only. Now a Python 3 compatible pull request from Brian Crowell [7]_ has been merged, and the final stages of release preparation are underway.

In early 2013, Barry Warsaw created an Ubuntu Personal Package Archive and tested it with Python 3 [8]_. And the Fedora Project is now planning to include Pillow with their release of Fedora 19 [9]_.

Finally, the Pillow project has promised a Python 3 compatible release of Pillow by PyCon 2013. Unfortunately as a volunteer, Alex Clark has been unable to allocate the time needed to properly complete the remaining critical tasks. Funding from the Python Software Foundation would help make it possible for him to do so [10]_.

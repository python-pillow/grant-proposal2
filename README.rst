python-pillow.org
=================

Proposal submitted to the Python Software Foundation Friday, February 10, 2017.

Grant Proposal
--------------

Provide funding to **renew python-pillow.org** for maximum period of time of 8 years. [0]_ By doing so, we can ensure security issues can be reported discretely to `security@python-pillow.org` for the foreseeable future.

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

The **Python Imaging Library** is one of the oldest and most popular third party libraries available to Python programmers today. It adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. [1]_

**Pillow** is a popular and well-maintained fork of the Python Imaging Library. At the time of this writing it has been downloaded over a 15 million times from the Python Package Index [2]_ and is now included in major Linux distributions like Debian and Ubuntu. [1]_

History
~~~~~~~

Frustrated with the proliferation of third party repackagings of PIL containing ad hoc changes, none of which were available to download from the Python Package Index, on July 31, 2010 **Alex Clark forked the Python Imaging Library** based on Hanno Schlicting's repackaging [4]_ and published the results to the Python Package Index as Pillow 1.0 [5]_.

Milestones
++++++++++

- The ability to add library paths to ``setup.py`` (e.g. 64 bit library and headers directories) and make timely releases quickly led to widespread adoption of Pillow within about two years.

- Just over a year after Pillow 1.0 was released, on 2011-09-08, Takayuki Shimizukawa [6]_ uploaded the first Windows (win32) eggs. Since then, every Pillow release included Windows eggs thanks to Takayuki. And on 2013-02-02, the first 64-bit Windows eggs (amd64) were uploaded to PyPI by Takayuki.

- For the first 3 years, the fork focused on packaging fixes only. In 2013, a Python 3 compatible pull request from Brian Crowell [7]_ was merged and released as Pillow 2.0.0.

- Shortly after the release of Pillow 2.0, Christoph Gohlke gave permission for the Pillow project to use his Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages. [8]_.

- **In 2014 the first of 12 (at present) CVEs was reported. At the time, no formal mechanism to contact the Pillow team existed. In 2016, python-pillow.org was registered and a security email address was configured to send mail to the Pillow team.** [9]_

- As of early 2017, Pillow is developed, maintained and released quarterly by 7 organization members and many more contributors.
